Butterfly Integrations connects [Butterfly](https://butterfly.linwood.dev) to
other applications while keeping your `.bfly` documents in the host you
already use. Integrations share a small, typed embed protocol package but are
built, versioned, and released independently.

## Integrations

### ☁️ Nextcloud

Open, create, edit, and save Butterfly documents directly from Nextcloud Files.
The integration protects saves with ETags, supports custom or self-hosted
Butterfly web builds, and validates every iframe message against its expected
window and origin.

[**Learn more**](integrations/nextcloud/README.md) ·
[**Download stable `.tar.gz`**](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/ButterflyIntegrations/releases/download/nextcloud%2Fstable/butterfly-nextcloud.tar.gz) ·
[**Download stable `.zip`**](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/ButterflyIntegrations/releases/download/nextcloud%2Fstable/butterfly-nextcloud.zip)

### 📝 Joplin

Open, create, edit, and save Butterfly documents from within a Joplin panel.

[**Learn more**](integrations/joplin/README.md) ·

### 💎 Obsidian

Planned. The directory is reserved, but the integration is not implemented or
built yet.

## Repository

```text
integrations/
  nextcloud/   # implemented and built in CI
  joplin/      # implemented and built in CI
  obsidian/    # reserved; not built
packages/
  shared/      # framework-neutral TypeScript helpers
```

The shared package contains the Butterfly embed message types, trusted event
validation, document conversion helpers, and `version.json` validation used by
browser-facing integrations.

## Development

Install Node.js 24 and pnpm 11, then run:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

See the [Nextcloud integration guide](integrations/nextcloud/README.md) for PHP,
Composer, and Docker setup. Obsidian is intentionally excluded from
the workspace until their implementations exist.

## Releases

Each integration has its own version namespace. For Nextcloud:

- `nextcloud/v1.0.0` is an immutable version release.
- `nextcloud/stable` moves to the newest stable version and keeps persistent
  asset URLs.
- Prereleases create a versioned release without changing `nextcloud/stable`.
- The matching integration changelog entry becomes the GitHub release body.

Versions, tag prefixes, and changelog locations are declared in each
implemented integration's `integration.json`.
